This folder contains **sample-template-native-sdk.html**; a sample template to be used together with the ios or android Github sample seed projects. 
It provides a simple html application that can be put into a mobile WebView to interface with our javascript bridge library (nativeSdkBridge.js).

To use the template, copy it into the root directory of the library package.
